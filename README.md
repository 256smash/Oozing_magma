# Overview:

"Oozing Magma" is a specialized mod crafted for Minecraft enthusiasts looking to amplify their Nether adventures. The mod introduces a captivating twist to the Nether environment by modifying the behavior of mobs affected by the enigmatic Oozing effect.

This alteration not only enhances thematic immersion but also presents players with more formidable adversaries to confront in the fiery depths of the Nether.

Whether you're a seasoned explorer craving fresh challenges or a creative builder seeking to enrich your Nether landscapes, "Oozing Magma" promises an enthralling addition to your Minecraft mod repertoire. Embrace the infernal allure of the Nether and brace yourself for an intensified gaming experience with this innovative mod.

# Considerations:

* Server-Side Only: "Oozing Magma" operates exclusively on the server side. While it functions in single-player mode, players on multiplayer servers will need server administrators to install the mod to receive its benefits.
* Dimension Compatibility: The mod's effects extend to dimensions designated as "ultrawarm." It's important to note that other modded dimensions with similar attributes may also witness the transformation of Slimes into Magma Cubes.
* Open to Suggestions: I welcome and consider suggestions that align with the mod's thematic focus and gameplay enhancement.
